# Technologies Used

# Testing this project
You can clone this project and test it for yourself. However, you need to create 'images' directory
for storing posts' thumbnails and users' avatar. Inside the 'images' directory, create 'avatar' and
'posts' directories. 

Next, if your XAMPP's entry point is 'htdocs' directory, create 'projects' directory in the
'htdocs' directory and put this directory there.

Next, export the database in 'db' directory to your mysql database manager. I use PHPmyadmin as my
mysql database manager.
